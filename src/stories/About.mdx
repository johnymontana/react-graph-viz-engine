# React Graph Visualization Engine
This [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) contains examples on how to use the **React Graph Visualization Engine** for Neo4j.

Key features of the library include:
- An easily embeddable React component to render force-directed graphs.
- Integrated translation into library specific formats from a unified standard (GraphQL).
- A straightforward way to add (rule-based) styling and interactions to your visualizations.
- Support for multiple renderers & graph layouts.
 
See also the [Github Repository](https://github.com/neo4j-field/react-graph-viz-engine) for more information, including example code.

## How to use this Storybook
The sidebar on the left contains various examples on how to use the library.

The Storybook provides examples for each of the functionalities this library provides. For each of these examples, you can:
* Change the config parameters in the **Controls** tab and see how they affect the visualization,
* Get the corresponding **JSX** definition of the React component in the adjacent panel

After installing the library with `npm install react-graph-viz-engine`, copy-paste the snippet into your code and you're ready to go. 


## Input data
There are two ways of providing graph data into the component:
1. Raw data. JSON-structured data can be passed to the component to render it directly. Make sure that your `data` field is structured in the standard GraphQL return format.  See [Simple Data](?path=/story/examples--simple-data) for an example.
2. From a GraphQL endpoint directly. You can use the  `graphqlUrl` and `graphqlQuery` fields to specify an endpoint and query, and the component will handle retrieving and parsing the data. See [Live GraphQL Data](?path=/story/examples--live-graph-ql-data) for an example.

## Renderers
one of the main features of this library is a **seamless switch** between different visualization libraries.
In the current release, two visualization libraries are supported:
- [cytoscape](https://js.cytoscape.org/)
- [react-force-graph](https://github.com/vasturiano/react-force-graph)

Change the `renderer` field of the component to switch the underlying graph visualization library.

## Configurations
The configurations for the component are described in the attached docs pages for each of the examples.
- `renderer`:  One of `['cytoscape', 'react-force-graph']`.
- `layout`: One of `['graph', 'tree']`.
- `style`: A dictionary with style definitions. See [Simple styling](/?path=/story/examples--simple-styling) and [Rule-based styling](?path=/story/examples--rule-based-styling) for examples.
- `schema` = A dictionary with schema-mapping configurations. See [Custom schema](?path=/story/examples--custom-schema) for an example.
- `interactions`: A dictionary with graph interaction methods. See [Interactions](?path=/story/examples--interactions) for an example.
- `showNavigator`: One of `[true, false]`. Optionally show a navigator window in the visualization (Cytoscape only).
